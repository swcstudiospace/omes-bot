## [Unreleased]

### v10 — Prime merge

#### Added

- Native `ai.complete` runs actual `pa_ai::complete_simple` in-process; native
  `ai.resolve_models` resolves Prime's real model catalog. One bounded Tokio
  runtime releases the GIL while waiting, checks Python interrupts, and bounds
  cancellation cleanup. Unknown options are errors, not silently ignored.
- `PrimeProviderModel` translates real tool schemas, images, tool results, and
  thinking. `OmegaPrimeAgent.from_prime` composes it with the existing loop and
  registry approvals. Durable `prime_message` transcript metadata preserves
  provider response IDs and opaque signatures across tool rounds and reloads.
- Restored Desk intake authority, contract-first change discipline, gate
  integrity, and live-gateway rules in the shared directives and assembled prompt.

- Prime Agent capabilities ported into the one Python agent (behavior port;
  see `docs/adr/0001-prime-merge-architecture.md`): RLM recursion
  (`rlm_spawn`/`rlm_collect`/`rlm_list_subagents`/`rlm_delete_subagent`/
  `rlm_create_session`/`rlm_progress_note`/`rlm_rename`), the continual harness
  (`harness_*` with evidence-backed refinement, snapshots, and exact
  rollback), persistent goals with token budgets and continuation prompts
  (`goal_*`), session heartbeats on the cron scheduler (`heartbeat_*`),
  bounded autonomous mode with a shell quality gate (`autonomous_*`), and
  agent-to-agent messaging (`agent_message_send`, `agent_observe`).
- `omega_prime/prime/` connector layer: typed, versioned adapters
  (`SCHEMA_VERSION`, strict decoders, structured `PrimeError`s) between the
  tool surface and every ported capability, with contract, failure-injection,
  and source-cited parity-fixture test suites.
- Registered capability handlers now consume the typed request/response boundary,
  including explicit versions and unknown fields, after policy and approval.
  Actual loop runs cover raises, timeout snapshots, malformed requests and stored
  responses, and valid recovery without fixed-sleep or guarded-hook-only proofs.
- `omega_prime/prime/heartbeat.py` (`SetRequest`, `ClearRequest`, `ListRequest`,
  `HeartbeatConnector` over `HeartbeatRuntime`) and `omega_prime/prime/kernel.py`
  (`CellRequest`, `FactoryRunRequest`, `RunRequest`, `FactoryGraphRequest`,
  `BashRequest`, `SkillListRequest`, `CratesRequest`, `GoalCommandRequest`,
  `AutonomousCommandRequest`, `KernelConnector`): every registered Prime tool
  now decodes through a versioned typed request. A rejected request never
  imports the pinned runtime, builds a kernel, or touches the filesystem.
- Assembler CLI `--output PATH`. With any `--enable-family` it is required; the
  canonical `prompts-assembled/OMEGA_PRIME.xml` is then never written or
  compared, and `--check` compares `PATH`.
- `OmegaPrimeAgent(..., session_dir=...)` supplies the durable directory the
  agent offers as an RLM parent. The RLM parent contract (`session_dir`,
  `session_name`, `delegate_depth`, `max_depth`, `max_children`) is checked by
  `require_parent` at `RlmHost` construction and at `register_rlm_tools` when a
  parent is given.
- RLM children persist atomic prompt/answer/identity/status documents, recover
  their owner's records without replay, and persist rename/delete lifecycle state.
  Collect waits for durable terminal settlement; list/delete are metadata-only.
  Bound kernel progress uses parent acceptance and throttling. Missing runners
  and kernel model selectors are explicit errors, not invented defaults.
- Default-off prompt assembly filters disabled Prime families; explicit config
  or repeated assembler family flags opt them in. Catalog metadata now reads
  real registrations rather than fabricated approval or parameter defaults.
- Source-executed pre-v10 transcripts at `79ff51af` preserve six actual consumer
  cases' messages, approvals, effects, errors, stops, and model-call accounting.
  The unmodified historical suite records two obsolete source/inventory-pin
  failures separately; no full unmodified-suite pass is asserted.
- `omega-prime.json` config surface: every Prime family is a default-off
  flag (`prime.<family>.enabled`, or `OMEGA_PRIME_PRIME_<FAMILY>_ENABLED`);
  default-off loop behavior is checked against actual historical transcripts.
- Wired registered goals and autonomous runs into the existing conversation
  loop: fresh goal state, once-only usage accounting across tool rounds and
  provider failures, cumulative continuation bounds, and honest stop reasons.
  Goal pause/clear/completion/limits veto continuation and completion gates;
  approval refusals remain refusals rather than capability degradation.
- Heartbeats now drive named live sessions through in-process APScheduler and
  wait behind foreground leases. Clear/reschedule remains safe during a beat;
  closing one owner preserves others, and last-owner shutdown settles callbacks.
  Due-now jobs fire immediately; later explicit stops cancel stale restarts.
- Capability hook failures emit redacted `prime_degraded` events and preserve
  the normal response without extending implicit work. Provider/control-flow
  exceptions remain errors; quality-gate success never implies goal completion.
- Rust parity-oracle CI (`rust-parity.yml`): the pinned prime-agent
  workspace builds and tests on a pinned toolchain with cargo-deny license
  enforcement; CI consumes the authoritative `contracts/prime-agent.pin.json`.
- Supply-chain CI: pip-audit workflow and dependabot for pip and
  github-actions; `.github/CODEOWNERS`.
- Docs: ADR 0001 (merge architecture), `connectors.md`, `agent-loop.md`,
  `migration.md`.
- `prime.kernel` (default off) loads the pinned `rlm` package in-process:
  persistent cells via `rlm.repl`, factory, `rlm.bash`, and skill packages
  from the checkout. `native/omega-prime-prime` is the PyO3 binding for
  the pinned crates. `prime_goal` and `prime_autonomous` call that
  binding. `crates.probe` calls each of the nine crates without starting
  the TUI or a daemon worker. See ADR 0002. The checkout sources are not
  modified.
- The seat prompt names each `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, each roster tool,
  and `routines/desk-lead.md`, `routines/nightly.md`, `routines/sweep.md`,
  and `routines/ultrathink.md`. The Grok template lists those skills and
  routines. Bodies stay in the skill files.
- `docs/driving-the-bot.md`: operator guide for a Prime-enabled Grok Bot. It
  covers which families the tool host can serve and what each does behind a
  Grok Bot, turning families on, `--approve`, building the effective prompt,
  checks, and troubleshooting. Linked from the README, setup, and FAQ.

#### Changed

- The MCP tool host flags a result as an error only when its `error` field is
  non-null. A payload carrying `"error": null` (`prime_crates` once the
  extension loaded, a successful `prime_cell`) was reported as failed.
- `prime_cell` returns what the cell printed while it ran as `stdout` and
  `stderr`. That output used to go to the tool host's own streams, so the bot
  never saw it. A cell that raises `SystemExit` or `KeyboardInterrupt` (`exit()`,
  `sys.exit()`) is now a cell error instead of ending the host.
- `.gitignore` covers the Prime family state the tool host writes under
  `--root`: `goals/`, `harness-local/`, `harness-global/`, `cron/`,
  `prime-kernel/`, and `prime-agent-dir/`.
- Corrected runtime documentation: linked-crate probes are not a full Prime
  application merge. Disabled families are absent from effective tools and
  canonical prompt entries; the policy contract remains an allowed superset.
  Native provider selection is independent of the kernel-tool flag.
  Optional typed hook imports now occur at their capability boundary, avoiding
  the cold assembler/registry import cycle without breaking legacy agent exports.
- Corrected loop boundaries for normal Anthropic `end_turn`/`stop_sequence`,
  idle-family last-call completion, and accepted-answer preservation when a later
  continuation is interrupted. Mixed component/total usage now charges every
  paid call once while preserving raw public/native metadata.
- Heartbeat validation now rejects non-finite, unrepresentable or non-advancing
  calendars before persistence, contains malformed rows without hot re-arming,
  preserves foreign scheduler entries, and catches up overdue work once.
  Reusing a shut-down injected backend is an explicit error.
- Harness refinement snapshots pre-change entries, so actual `harness_refine`
  followed by `harness_rollback` restores prior entries without rewriting the
  fixed base prompt or audit trail.
- Removed obsolete source/default/wording pins rather than repinning incidental
  assertions; actual loop, source-policy, pinned-checkout and native checks
  retain consumer and provenance evidence.
- Native source headers and a tracked license allowlist cover the product bridge;
  its independent CI job builds and checks licenses even if upstream parity
  tests fail. Cargo Dependabot remains an explicit REPO-04 audit gate because
  its required pinned path manifests are ignored, not repository-fetchable.
- Corrected broken repository links and the clone URL to
  `swcstudiospace/omes-bot`. Upstream Rust diagnostics retain their known nonzero
  baseline rather than appearing as a passing quickstart step.
- Every Prime tool family (rlm, harness, goals, heartbeat, autonomous,
  messaging, kernel) accepts only its declared parameters plus `schema_version`.
  Any undeclared key, including session-bound or alias fields (`sender`,
  `session`, `scope`, `stale_after_turns`, `mark_read`, `cwd`), is rejected with
  `unknown_field` and is never merged into the decoded payload. Omitted required
  fields reach the typed decoder (`bad_type`; closed vocabularies such as the
  harness `kind` give `bad_value`), and `schema_version` must be >= 1.
- `ToolRegistry.dispatch` audits a typed failure with verdict `error` and reason
  `<code>: <reason>` and a policy or approval refusal with verdict `denied`;
  the order is policy, then approval, then decode.
- `agent_message_send` and `agent_observe` take `sender` and `session` only from
  the session bound at registration, so a forged sender and a cross-session
  inbox read or consume are impossible. Connector errors are mapped by cause:
  `bad_value` (empty body), `unknown_sender`, `unknown_recipient`, and
  `unknown_session`.
- `goal_set` replaces the whole goal (objective, steps, and the Prime sidecar)
  after validating everything up front (`PrimeGoalStore.replace_goal`). Blank
  steps are `bad_value`, a rejected request writes nothing, previous steps never
  carry into the new goal, and the result is the status after the steps are
  applied. `stale_after_turns` is not a tool argument.
- Harness tools take `global_` as the only scope input; a `scope` key is
  `unknown_field`.
- `autonomous_start` rejects a non-finite `max_minutes` (NaN, +/-Infinity) as
  `bad_value`.
- RLM spawn's depth bound now reads the parent's `delegate_depth`, and there is
  no silent working-directory default for the session directory.
- `rlm_create_session` has no `cwd`: the tool rejects it as `unknown_field`, and
  the typed request accepts `cwd=None` (the pinned SDK sends it) but rejects any
  other value with `bad_value`.
- RLM admission (name, child limit, depth bound, registration) is one atomic
  section, and the roster record is created only after admission.
- RLM recovery rewrites only interrupted records and survives a failing write:
  the record stays registered in memory as an error naming the failed write.
  One live host per (`session_dir`, owner `session_name`) is the supported
  assumption.
- RLM delete tombstones keep only identity, owner, and status; they hold no
  prompt, answer, or error text.
- `rlm_collect` reports `answer_preview` and `error` only for settled children.
  `collect` and `list_subagents` read the in-memory registry under a lock that
  no file write holds, so they never block behind a durable write.
- Tool-call arguments in the conversation loop must be a JSON object. `None`
  and the empty string mean no arguments; any other malformed or non-object
  payload (truncated JSON, a list, a number, `null`, whitespace-only text)
  yields an `error:` tool row and the call is not executed, while the other
  calls in the round still run.
- The refusal stop reasons `approval_refused` and `policy_refused` describe the
  most recent tool round of the run only, so a refusal the model recovered from
  does not make the turn terminal.
- The pre-v10 transcript comparator (`tests/test_prime_regression.py`) is
  documented as covering `Agent`/`run_conversation` with a test-local
  dispatcher; the registered public agent's error rows are covered by
  `tests/test_prime_failure_injection.py` and the boundary tests.

- The retained Rust diagnostic in `VENDOR.md` must run with no published
  `prime-agent` binary on `PATH`. That binary is not the TypeScript
  oracle `pa-cli` differential tests compare against. With 0.9.8 on
  `PATH`, `ts_daemon_differential_cli_output` runs and fails: `send`
  exits 1 on both sides with `No API key found for the selected model`
  instead of the `Sent to ...` receipt.
- The same command must run without ambient provider credentials
  (`GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`). The parity workflow
  unsets them. `cache_rejects_replacement_and_same_length_in_place_rewrite`
  can flake where `futimens` does not bump ctime (Linux 6.8.0-142 / ext4
  here); it is not a pin exclusion, and CI remains the gate.
- `imported_session_compacts` fails on this ext4 `/tmp` because the test
  reads the first `grown-import*` directory entry, and `readdir` returns
  the window sidecar `grown-import.window-cache.json` before the session
  file. The import succeeds; the counted message rows are 0 instead of
  3600. It is not a pin exclusion.

  Co. Upstream-ported modules retain their MIT attributions (VENDOR.md);
  new source files carry SPDX headers. See `docs/migration.md`.
- Supply-chain audit reads `requirements-lock.txt` and ignores
  PYSEC-2026-4114. That advisory is an oauthlib authorization-server PKCE
  timing oracle; tweepy 4.17 pins `oauthlib<4`, and this process does not
  host that grant. See SECURITY.md.

### Added

- Pinned development lint/type checks and a Python 3.12–3.14 CI matrix with
  a reproducible dependency lock and an audioop-safe Discord import.
- Provider transient-failure retries, per-turn token usage, OpenAI Responses
  routing with chat-completions fallback, and streamed conversation turns.
- Hermetic PyRIT multi-turn attack campaigns and scorer-based judging.
- SEC-NET 2.2.0 egress transport hardening and verified browser sandbox boundary
  confinement (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)).

### Changed

- Renamed the product from Omes Bot to Omega Prime: Python package `omes` is
  now `omega_prime`, the distribution is `omega-prime`, the seat is
  `bot-00-omega-prime`, contracts moved to `contracts/tool-rosters/omega-prime.yaml`
  and `contracts/policies/omega-prime.json`, the template is
  `grokbot/templates/OMEGA_PRIME.md`, and `OMES_*` environment variables are
  now `OMEGA_PRIME_*`.
- Documentation search now returns bounded, redacted excerpts and explicit
  citation provenance instead of copying the raw retrieval response.
- Ultrathink mark evals exercise the real approval contract through an injected
  runner; removing the production approval requirement fails the red-team case.
- Setup and tool documentation reflect the default tool surface: the roster YAML
  lists 146 names including the 37 Prime tools, the default assembled prompt names
  109, and the default MCP registry serves 108 because it skips `delegate_task`
  (it needs a live agent). Test/eval totals are reported by CI instead of
  pinned in prose.
- Replaced incidental source/configuration-copy assertions with executable
  lint/type/catalog gates and consumer-visible regression coverage.
- CI jobs share a stdlib receipt helper, preserving command failures and
  distinguishing missing, skipped, cancelled, and failed validation evidence.

### Fixed

- Prevented retrieval content, metadata, and error messages from bypassing
  existing credential redaction at registry, MCP, and model boundaries.
- Distinguished malformed docs responses from valid searches with no hits.
