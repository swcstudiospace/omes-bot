"""One conversation turn: interrupt, budget, one model call, tool round or text, finalize.

Adapted from Hermes ``agent/conversation_loop.py`` (``run_conversation`` and the
iteration in ``_run_conversation_turn``) and ``agent/turn_iteration_prep.py``.
The system prompt is installed once, before the loop, and is not rebuilt after
a tool round. Messages already appended are not rewritten here; compression is
the only sanctioned rewrite, and this loop does not call it.

class Agent:
    """What the loop reads. Not ``AIAgent``: no credential, gateway, or callback parameters.

    ``tools`` is a name → callable map. ``interrupt`` is polled at the start of each
    iteration. ``pending_steer`` is delivered as its own user row after a tool result.
    ``lease`` is held for the turn. A budget the caller omits is per-turn and refilled
    from ``max_iterations``. A budget the caller passes is a session cap and is not reset.

    Omp harness options (all ``None`` by default, keeping the Hermes turn): ``before_model``
    may mutate the outgoing request or stop the turn before it is billed; ``pause_gate``
    parks the loop at both action boundaries; ``output_budget`` caps model-visible
    output chars; ``speculative_tools`` names discard-safe tools to pre-execute.

    Omp mode options: ``plan_mode`` refuses write tools without calling them;
    ``extensions`` is an :class:`ExtensionHooks` whose ``before_model`` hooks run
    before the legacy ``before_model`` hook each iteration.

    Durability options: ``journal`` is a :class:`TurnJournal` that persists
    every appended row; ``run_id`` names the run (a fresh hex id by default).

    Observability: ``tracer`` is a :class:`Tracer` recording one span per
    model call.

    Magic keywords: ``magic_keywords`` is a
    :class:`MagicKeywordSettings` (all on when omitted). A user turn
    containing ``ultrathink``, ``orchestrate``, or ``workflowz`` as
    standalone prose gains that word's notice rows for the turn.

    Substrate surface: ``substrate`` is a :class:`SubstrateSession` (or
    duck-typed equivalent). Each turn opens it once (brief cached after the
    first open), prepends its brief block to the system prompt, and emits
    the prompt plus a turn-end note. Tool calls are reported from the tool
    round. ``None`` keeps the turn fully local.

    Prime hooks: ``prime_hooks`` is a :class:`PrimeHooks` built from the
    registry's ``runtime_bindings`` (or ``None``). ``None`` keeps the exact
    pre-v10 turn: no implicit continuation, no usage accounting, no extra
    result keys.
