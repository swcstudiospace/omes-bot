"""Production desk-pass driver: due ``desk_lead_pass`` jobs on a thread.

Phase 64 DESK-04. The desk pass is a cron job kind
(``omega_prime.cron.scheduler.DESK_LEAD_KIND``) riding the same
:class:`~omega_prime.cron.scheduler.JobStore` file everything else uses; this
driver is the process-side owner that ticks those jobs without a manual call.
It follows the :class:`~omega_prime.cron.apscheduler_backend.SchedulerService`
shape — one background thread plus a lock, fire-serialized — and the heartbeat
store-path convention (``root/cron/jobs.json``, the file
``omega_prime.tools.heartbeat`` and :class:`HeartbeatRuntime` resolve). A fresh
``JobStore`` is built per tick so a store written by another process (or by
``SchedulerService``'s model-driven tick, which skips desk jobs) is always
reloaded, never clobbered.

Serialization: one worker thread runs one pass at a time, and the disk claim
in :func:`~omega_prime.cron.scheduler.tick_desk_lead_passes` makes a
concurrent tick (another thread or another process) a no-op. A ``parent`` of
``None`` never crashes the server: every ticket comes back explicitly blocked
with a failure receipt, never a fabricated success.
