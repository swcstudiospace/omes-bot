"""Named-session heartbeat delivery over the persisted job store (LOOP-02).

A :class:`HeartbeatRuntime` owns one ``root/cron/jobs.json`` path plus its
live APScheduler entries. Beats re-enter the exact named live session through
the runner captured by :meth:`bind`; unknown names are explicit errors, never
a fresh conversation.

Lock discipline: the state lock guards bindings, the in-flight set, the
started flag, the lifecycle epoch, scheduler identity/freshness, the
callback-thread table, and the shutdown-drain depth, plus
every persisted read-modify-write cycle (fresh :class:`JobStore` reload per
boundary, so external/tool updates are immediately authoritative and no
stale snapshot can clobber a concurrent update). The lock is never held
across session-lease waiting, the bound runner callback, diagnostic sinks,
in-flight settlement, or ``scheduler.shutdown(wait=True)``, so a foreground
turn holding the lease cannot deadlock a background beat and a settling
beat (which needs the lock to finish) cannot deadlock a concurrent stop.
``stop``/``close``/last-owner ``unbind`` bump the epoch and settle
already-executing beats even when the scheduler never started, so a stale
``start`` can never restart scheduling after a later stop/close; a shut-down
owned scheduler is recreated on the next ``start`` instead of submitting to
a dead executor. While a shutdown drain is active no new beat starts, so a
wait cannot race recurring execution; shutdown from inside a callback or
sink is rejected before any lifecycle mutation.
