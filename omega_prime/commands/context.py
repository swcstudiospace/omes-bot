"""Host-scoped nested dispatch.

Core commands dispatch tools through ``registry.dispatch`` when nothing has
set a nested dispatcher. The Grok Bot host sets one for the duration of a
``tools/call`` so inner calls re-enter that call's roster and interceptor
chain. The context variable is empty for in-process callers (the agent
intercept, cron), which keep registry-gate semantics.
