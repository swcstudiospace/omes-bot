"""Lead pass routine: claim intake, ticket, dispatch, consolidate, report.

The desk LEAD flow as an Omega Prime routine. Each open order becomes one ticket;
tickets dispatch through an injected `dispatch(ticket)` callable (the desk
never invents specialist work, so without a dispatcher tickets go blocked);
intakes are acked from the outcomes and every receipt is validated before
the report consolidates it. Invalid receipts are listed, never dropped.

Production wiring (Phase 64 DESK-04): :func:`make_dispatch` builds the real
dispatch closure — ticket → one child agent turn through the runtime's parent
shim → a receipt dict in the :mod:`omega_prime.receipts` shape — and
:func:`desk_intake_path` names the one ``IntakeStore`` file the lead tools and
the cron ``desk_lead_pass`` job kind (``omega_prime.cron.scheduler``) share.
A dispatcher that cannot run a child returns an explicit blocked outcome with
a failure receipt; success is never fabricated. ``dispatch=None`` stays a
test-only shape: production callers always pass a closure.
