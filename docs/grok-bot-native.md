# Grok Bot native host

Run the Omega Prime tool host on a machine you control and point a Grok Bot
at it. The same process serves legacy MCP SSE and Streamable HTTP, with one
roster, one seat policy, and one approval log.

The ten-minute path is section 3 of
`omega_prime/grokbot/SETUP.md`. This page is the operator reference for the
running host. Container, compose, systemd, and Kubernetes installs are
[Deploying the tool host](deploy.md). What each Prime family does behind a
bot is [Driving the bot](driving-the-bot.md). Sandbox notes stay on
[Tool host](tool-host.md).

The default roster serves 108 tools. `delegate_task` is not one of them: it
needs a live parent agent. Prime families stay off until
`omega-prime.json` turns them on.

## One-command start

`./scripts/grokbot-1click.sh` finds the repo and runs
`python -m omega_prime.grokbot.oneclick` with the same arguments.

```bash
# local process (IDE or sandbox); no HTTP listener
./scripts/grokbot-1click.sh --transport stdio

# remote host: doctor, bind check, optional manifest, then serve
./scripts/grokbot-1click.sh --transport sse --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 \
  --public-url https://bot.example.com \
  --generate-token --token-file ~/.config/omega-prime/token \
  --token-store ~/.config/omega-prime/tokens.json \
  --log-format json \
  --export-manifest grokbot-manifest.json
```

`--transport` is `stdio` (the default) or `sse`. On SSE the launcher, in
order:

1. Resolves a bearer token: `--token-file` if that file exists, else
   `--token`, else the environment variable named by `--token-env` (default
   `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`). A missing `--token-file` is allowed only with
   `--generate-token`.
2. Refuses a non-loopback bind with no token and no `--token-store` (exit 2).
   `--allow-insecure-no-auth` is the explicit opt-out and prints a warning.
3. Runs the preflight doctor unless `--skip-doctor`. A failed check aborts
   with exit 3 when strict (the default for `sse`; stdio defaults to
   non-strict). Warnings do not abort. `--no-strict` continues anyway.
4. With `--export-manifest`, or on `--dry-run`, writes the manifest. The
   file never contains a token.
5. Serves, unless `--dry-run`, which stops after the checks and the export.

`--generate-token` is SSE-only. It mints a token when none is configured,
prints it once on stderr, and with `--token-file` saves it mode 0600. If a
token is already configured the flag is ignored. The token is never written
to stdout, to `--json` output, or to the manifest. `--token` on the command
line still works and warns: other users can read argv.

`--public-url` must be an `http` or `https` URL with a host. The manifest
records `<url>/sse`. `--log-format` is `text` (default) or `json` and is
forwarded to the server. `--token-store PATH` is a hashed multi-token file;
giving one counts as authentication for the bind check.

Other launcher flags: `--root`, `--host` (default `127.0.0.1`), `--port`
(default 8000), `--allow-origin` and `--allow-host` (repeatable),
`--audit-log`, `--json` (one JSON object on stdout; text on stderr).

Exit codes: 0 success, 2 configuration (bad token, unsafe bind, bad public
URL, `--generate-token` without SSE), 3 a failed doctor check while strict.

Rate limits, the circuit breaker, session caps, and metrics stay at the
server defaults under the launcher. Set them on
`python -m omega_prime.mcp_server` (below).

## The server command

```bash
python -m omega_prime.mcp_server --transport sse --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 \
  --token-file ~/.config/omega-prime/token \
  --token-store ~/.config/omega-prime/tokens.json \
  --public-url https://bot.example.com \
  --audit-log /var/lib/omega-prime/audit.jsonl \
  --log-format json
```

`--transport sse` is the remote host. `--transport stdio` (the default)
speaks MCP on stdin/stdout and does not listen. Token order on the server
is `--token-file`, then `--token`, then `--token-env`. A token file must be
a regular file and must not be group- or world-accessible (`chmod 600`).
The minimum token length is 16 characters.

Useful server flags (each maps to the running host; `0` disables a limit
where the help text says so):

| Flag | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--rate-limit N` | 600 | HTTP requests per minute per principal |
| `--global-rate-limit N` | 0 | HTTP requests per minute for every principal together |
| `--tool-rate-limit N` | 300 | Tool calls per minute per principal |
| `--auth-failure-limit N` | 10 | Auth failures per 60 seconds per client |
| `--breaker-threshold N` | 5 | Infrastructure failures before a tool's circuit opens |
| `--breaker-cooldown SECONDS` | 30 | How long that circuit stays open |
| `--no-metrics` | metrics on | Do not mount `/metrics` |
| `--metrics-scope {read,call,admin}` | `read` | Scope required to read `/metrics` |
| `--log-format {text,json}` | `text` | Process log format |
| `--session-idle-timeout SECONDS` | 1800 | Drop an idle Streamable HTTP session |
| `--max-sessions N` | 64 | Concurrent Streamable HTTP sessions |
| `--approval-max-ttl SECONDS` | 86400 | Longest TTL `POST /admin/approvals` accepts |
| `--max-body-bytes N` | 1048576 | Largest accepted request body |
| `--shutdown-grace SECONDS` | 20 | Drain window after the first SIGTERM or SIGINT |
| `--approve TOOL:APPROVER` | none | Pre-approve one gated tool at startup (repeatable) |
| `--allow-host`, `--allow-origin` | loopback only | Extra Host and Origin values (repeatable) |
| `--allow-insecure-no-auth` | off | Listen on a non-loopback address with no credential |
| `--no-roster` | roster on | Serve every registered tool, not the roster |

A negative limit, or a non-positive `--session-idle-timeout`,
`--max-sessions`, or `--approval-max-ttl`, is a usage error (exit 2) before
either transport starts. Configuration the host refuses — a short token, an
unauthenticated non-loopback bind, a bad public URL, an invalid roster or
seat policy — also exits 2, with `omega-prime-mcp-server:` and the reason
on stderr.

## Endpoints

Public probes (no token):

| Method | Path | Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/healthz` | `{"status":"healthy","service":"omega-prime-mcp-server","version","package_version","rostered_tools","auth"}`. `auth` is `required` or `disabled`. |
| GET | `/readyz` | 200 `{"ready":true,"checks":...}` or 503. Checks: `registry`, `roster`, `policy`, `audit`, `shutdown`, `token_store`, `streamable_http`. 503 while draining, when the audit log is not writable, when a token-store file is unreadable or corrupt (`token_store: degraded`), or when the Streamable HTTP lifespan is down. |

Authenticated when a token or token store is configured (bearer; see below).
With authentication disabled, `/admin/*` is not mounted (404) and
`/manifest.json` is public. `/metrics` is still mounted unless
`--no-metrics`, but it requires a principal, so with authentication off it
answers 401.

| Method | Path | Who |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/sse` | Legacy SSE stream. |
| POST | `/messages/` | Legacy SSE inbound channel. |
| GET, POST, DELETE | `/mcp` | Streamable HTTP. A body over `--max-body-bytes` is 413. Session number `--max-sessions` + 1 is 503. A session idle for `--session-idle-timeout` seconds is dropped and its id then 404s. |
| GET | `/manifest.json` | Scope `read` when authentication is on; public when it is off. The manifest of the settings this process is actually using, built once and cached. Tool count matches `/healthz` `rostered_tools`. Includes `approval_required` and a `digest`. `auth.type` is `bearer` when authentication is on. The token value is never in the document. The recorded URL is the SSE URL; Streamable HTTP is the `/mcp` route on the same origin. |
| GET | `/metrics` | Scope from `--metrics-scope` (default `read`). Prometheus text, `text/plain; version=0.0.4; charset=utf-8`. Absent with `--no-metrics`. With authentication off there is no principal, so the route answers 401. |
| GET | `/admin/approvals` | Scope `admin`. Live approvals and gated tool names. |
| POST | `/admin/approvals` | Scope `admin`. Approve one gated tool. |
| DELETE | `/admin/approvals/{tool}` | Scope `admin`. Revoke one approval. |

Every response carries `X-Request-Id` and a W3C `traceparent`.

A client sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Grok Bot cloud instances use
the SSE URL (`<public-url>/sse` or `http://<host>:<port>/sse`). Current MCP
clients use `<origin>/mcp`. A session on `/mcp` belongs to the principal
that opened it: someone else's `Mcp-Session-Id` is 404, the same answer as
an unknown session.

## Security model

Authentication reads the `Authorization` header only. A token in the query
string, including `?token=`, is ignored and the request is 401 with
`WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="omega-prime"`. Comparison is constant time
over SHA-256 digests. Failure records carry a reason (`missing`,
`malformed`, `invalid`), never the credential.

### Scopes

Three scopes, each covering the ones below it: `admin` includes `call` and
`read`; `call` includes `read`.

| Scope | Allows |
| --- | --- |
| `read` | `GET /manifest.json` and, by default, `GET /metrics` |
| `call` | Those, plus tool calls |
| `admin` | Those, plus `/admin/approvals` |

The single token from `--token-file`, `--token`, or `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` is one
principal, id `env-token`, with scopes `read` and `call`. It can list and
call tools. It receives 403 on `/admin/approvals`. A read-only store token
that calls a tool gets an MCP error result
`forbidden: principal <id> lacks the call scope`. That denial is written to
the audit log and counted in `omega_tool_denials_total`.

There is no OAuth, no refresh, and no per-tenant seat. Principals are
credentials on this one process.

### Token file and the token store

`--token-file` is one plaintext line, mode 0600. The hashed store is a
different file, `--token-store`, managed by:

```bash
python -m omega_prime.grokbot.tokens new --file ~/.config/omega-prime/tokens.json \
  --label bot
python -m omega_prime.grokbot.tokens new --file ~/.config/omega-prime/tokens.json \
  --scope admin --label approver
python -m omega_prime.grokbot.tokens list --file ~/.config/omega-prime/tokens.json
python -m omega_prime.grokbot.tokens list --file ~/.config/omega-prime/tokens.json --json
python -m omega_prime.grokbot.tokens revoke --file ~/.config/omega-prime/tokens.json tok_1a2b3c4d
```

`new` prints the plaintext token once on stdout and the id on stderr. The
file stores SHA-256 only, mode 0600, shape
`{"version":1,"tokens":[{"id","sha256","scopes","label","created_at","expires_at","revoked_at"}]}`.
Ids are `tok_` plus 8 hex digits. `--scope` is repeatable (`read`, `call`,
`admin`); omitted, the token gets `read` and `call`. `--label` is free
text. `--ttl-days` must be positive. `list` never prints digests. `revoke`
marks the id; an unknown id exits 1.

The host re-reads the file when its size or mtime changes, at most once a
second. A revoked or expired token fails the next check with 401 and the
process does not restart. An unreadable or corrupt store denies every token
in that store and `/readyz` reports `token_store: degraded` (503). If a
single bearer token is also configured, that token still verifies; the file
store is consulted first. Readiness stays 503 until the file can be parsed.

Give the bot a `read`+`call` token. Keep `admin` on a separate token. The
approver recorded for a grant is that token's label, or its id when the
label is empty — never the bot.

### Host and Origin

Host validation is on when the bind is loopback, or you set `--public-url`,
or you pass `--allow-host`. Allowed Host values then include loopback
(`127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, `::1`), the bind address, and the public URL's
host. `--allow-origin` adds browser origins; `--public-url` adds its origin.
CORS answers only origins you named, never `*`.

On a non-loopback bind with a credential but no public URL and no
`--allow-host`, Host validation stays off. A request that sends an `Origin`
not on the allow list to `/sse`, `/messages`, or `/mcp` is still 403
(`Invalid Origin header`). A client that sends no `Origin` passes that check.

### Audit log

Every tool call and every authentication failure is one JSON line in a
hash-chained log. The default path is `$OMEGA_PRIME_AUDIT_LOG` or
`./.planning/grokbot_audit.jsonl`. The server's `--audit-log` overrides it.
New files are mode 0600.

Argument values are not stored. A tool-call record keeps the argument key
names (`arg_keys`) and a SHA-256 of the canonical arguments (`args_sha256`).
`details` is redacted before it is hashed (bearer tokens, `omk_` tokens,
API-key assignments, `Authorization` and `Cookie` values).

```bash
python -m omega_prime.grokbot.audit verify
python -m omega_prime.grokbot.audit verify --path /var/lib/omega-prime/audit.jsonl --all
python -m omega_prime.grokbot.audit tail -n 20
```

`verify` exits 0 when the chain is intact and 1 when a record was edited,
removed, or reordered (it names the first bad line). `--all` includes
rotated backups (`.1`, `.2`, …). `tail` prints the newest records as JSON
lines; `-n` defaults to 20.

## Approval gateway

Approval-gated tools (deploys, publishes, merges, tracker writes) stay
gated. `--approve TOOL:APPROVER` grants one at startup. Otherwise an admin
principal grants a TTL at runtime. The bot's own token cannot: a `call`
token receives 403 `{"error":"admin scope required"}`, and the approval log
refuses an approver equal to the seat id `bot-00-omega-prime`.

The routes exist only when authentication is enabled. Bodies larger than
4096 bytes are 413. The JSON object may contain only `tool` and
`ttl_seconds`. Omit `ttl_seconds` and the grant lasts
`min(3600, --approval-max-ttl)` seconds. A non-positive TTL, or one above
`--approval-max-ttl`, is 422 (it is not clamped). A name that is not in the
gated set is 404. Revoking a missing or already expired approval is 404.

```bash
# gated names, and approvals that are still live
curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/approvals

# 201: approved, tool, approved_by, expires_at
curl -sS -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tool":"TOOL","ttl_seconds":600}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/approvals

# {"revoked":true}
curl -sS -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/approvals/TOOL
```

Replace `TOOL` with a name from `gated_tools` in the list response. Grants
are audited as `approval_granted` and revokes as `approval_revoked`, with
the tool, the TTL, and the approver. The approval log is in memory: a
restart drops it. Startup `--approve` flags are applied again on the next
start.

## Traffic protection

These knobs are on `python -m omega_prime.mcp_server`. `/healthz` and
`/readyz` are never limited and never count as auth failures. `0` disables
the HTTP limit, the global HTTP limit, the tool-call limit, the auth-failure
throttle, and the breaker (`--breaker-threshold 0`). `--breaker-cooldown 0`
does not disable the breaker; it only shortens the open period.

- **HTTP rate limit.** `--rate-limit` (default 600 requests/min per
  principal; the bucket holds that many, then refills). The key is the
  principal id, or the client address when there is no principal.
  `--global-rate-limit` (default 0, off) caps every principal together. A
  denial is 429 `{"error":"rate_limited","retry_after":n}` plus a
  `Retry-After` header, `n` in whole seconds.
- **Tool-call rate limit.** `--tool-rate-limit` (default 300/min per
  principal, or `local` when the caller has no principal). The denial is an
  MCP error, code `rate_limited`, and it is audited.
- **Auth-failure throttle.** `--auth-failure-limit` (default 10 failures in
  60 seconds per client address). Further requests from that client are 429
  `{"error":"too_many_auth_failures","retry_after":n}` and do not reach
  authentication, so they do not extend the window.
- **Circuit breaker.** `--breaker-threshold` (default 5) consecutive
  infrastructure failures on one tool open its circuit for
  `--breaker-cooldown` seconds (default 30), jittered by 20 percent. While
  open, calls are denied with code `circuit_open` and the tool does not
  run. After the cooldown one probe is allowed. Infrastructure means an
  `upstream_error`, a handler exception, a timeout, or a connection
  failure. Policy, approval, validation, `not_configured`, `forbidden`,
  `rate_limited`, and `circuit_open` do not open the breaker.

Both transports share one gate, so a limit or an open circuit applies
whether the client used `/sse` or `/mcp`.

## Observability

`GET /metrics` (scope `read` unless `--metrics-scope` says otherwise)
exposes:

| Series | Labels |
| --- | --- |
| `omega_http_requests_total` | `method`, `path` (a fixed group: `/sse`, `/messages`, `/mcp`, `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/metrics`, `/manifest.json`, `/admin`, or `other`), `status` class |
| `omega_http_request_duration_seconds` | `method`, `path` |
| `omega_http_in_flight` | — |
| `omega_tool_calls_total` | `tool` (or `unknown` if the name is not served), `status` (`ok`, `error`, `denied`) |
| `omega_tool_call_duration_seconds` | `tool` |
| `omega_tool_calls_in_flight` | — |
| `omega_tool_denials_total` | `code` |
| `omega_auth_failures_total` | `reason` (`missing`, `malformed`, `invalid`, `other`) |
| `omega_build_info` | `version`, `package_version` (value 1) |

The host mints `X-Request-Id` (the first 16 hex characters of the trace id)
and ignores a client-supplied one. A well-formed inbound `traceparent` is
continued with a new span; a malformed one is replaced and not echoed. The
same request id is stored on the audit record for that call.

`--log-format json` writes one JSON object per line on the `omega_prime`
logger: `ts` (UTC), `level`, `logger`, `msg`, `request_id`, and any
JSON-safe extra fields. `text` is the plain format. Both redact credentials
before the line is emitted. The access log (`omega_prime.access`) records
method, path with the query string removed, status, duration, principal id,
and request id. It does not record headers or bodies. The server's own
uvicorn access log is off, so a token a client puts in a URL is not written
there either.

## Operations

**Doctor** — preflight, no server required:

```bash
python -m omega_prime.grokbot.doctor --host 0.0.0.0 --auth --strict
```

Checks Python and the venv, the `prime-agent` checkout, the assembled
prompt, MCP dependencies, manifest generation, seat policy, the roster,
template integrity, the audit chain, bind exposure, token strength,
connector secret names (not values), and whether `--port` (default 8000)
is free. `--json` prints a machine-readable summary. Exit 1 on any failure;
with `--strict`, on any warning too.

**Supervisor** — restarts a crashed or unhealthy child, capped exponential
backoff, budget resets after `--stable-after` seconds (default 60). Exit 1
when `--max-restarts` (default 5) is exhausted. The default child is
`python -m omega_prime.mcp_server --transport sse`.

```bash
python -m omega_prime.grokbot.supervisor \
  --state-file .planning/grokbot_supervisor.json \
  --health-url http://127.0.0.1:8000/healthz -- \
  python -m omega_prime.mcp_server --transport sse \
  --token-file ~/.config/omega-prime/token
python -m omega_prime.grokbot.supervisor --status \
  --state-file .planning/grokbot_supervisor.json
python -m omega_prime.grokbot.supervisor --stop \
  --state-file .planning/grokbot_supervisor.json
```

`--stop` signals the supervisor, which then stops the child (SIGTERM, then
SIGKILL after `--stop-grace`, default 10 seconds).

**Emulator** — the same runtime the server uses (roster, seat policy,
approvals, audit), in-process:

```bash
python -m omega_prime.grokbot.emulator --smoke
python -m omega_prime.grokbot.emulator --tool todo_read --args '{}' --json
```

`--approve TOOL:APPROVER` pre-approves for that run. A failed smoke exits 1;
bad configuration exits 2.

**Sync** — drift against a saved manifest, only in content the bot would
see (instructions, skills, routines, tools, approval-gated tools,
capabilities). A manifest exported for another transport or URL is not
drift. Exit 1 on drift, 2 on a bad file.

```bash
python -m omega_prime.grokbot.sync --check grokbot-manifest.json
python -m omega_prime.grokbot.sync --export-prompt prompt.xml --json
```

On SIGTERM or SIGINT the host sets `/readyz` to 503 and waits for in-flight
tool calls, up to `--shutdown-grace` seconds (default 20), then exits 0.
With nothing in flight that is about a second. A second signal forces exit.

## Live verifier

`python -m omega_prime.grokbot.verify` checks a host that is already
running (this machine or a deployed container). It does not print the
token.

```bash
python -m omega_prime.grokbot.verify \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:8000 \
  --token-file ~/.config/omega-prime/token \
  --admin-token-env OMEGA_PRIME_ADMIN_TOKEN \
  --transport both \
  --json
```

Flags: `--url` (required), `--token-env NAME` or `--token-file PATH`,
`--admin-token-env NAME`, `--transport sse|http|both`, `--gated-tool NAME`,
`--require-auth`, `--timeout S` (default 10), `--json`. The human table
goes to stderr. `--json` writes the report to stdout. Exit 0 when every
check passed or was skipped, 1 when any failed, 2 on bad usage or an
unreachable URL.

The checks cover `/healthz` and `/readyz`, missing and invalid bearer
tokens, a token in `?token=` still 401, a foreign `Origin` rejected,
`X-Request-Id` and `traceparent`, `/manifest.json` (tool count matches
`rostered_tools`, a digest is present, the token string is absent), and
`/metrics` (`omega_http_requests_total`, auth required). For each requested
transport it initializes, lists tools, calls one read-only tool (preferring
`todo_read`), calls an unknown name, and calls an approval-gated tool
expecting a refusal. With `--admin-token-env` it also checks that the call
token is forbidden on `/admin/approvals` and that approve, then revoke,
opens and closes the gate. The gated tool is not run for its side effects.

```bash
python -m omega_prime.grokbot.oneclick --self-test
```

`--self-test` picks a free loopback port, mints a token into a mode-0600
temp file, starts
`python -m omega_prime.mcp_server --transport sse` on that port, waits for
`/readyz`, runs the verifier on both transports with auth required, sends
SIGTERM, and requires exit 0 within the drain grace plus five seconds. It
conflicts with `--dry-run` (usage error), never prints the token, removes
its temp files, and exits 0 only when every check passed.

## Deployment

Images, compose, systemd, and Kubernetes are rendered and checked with
`python -m omega_prime.grokbot.deploy`. The hardening, the token mount, the
state volume, and the probe paths are [Deploying the tool host](deploy.md).
Do not copy those manifests from this page.

The image is about 2 GB because the dependency tree includes PyRIT and
transformers. Every target runs non-root on a read-only root filesystem
with one writable state volume.

## Limits

- Credentials are static scoped bearer tokens. This host does not speak
  OAuth.
- One seat. One process, one roster, one seat policy. Scopes separate
  callers; they do not create tenants.
- Tools run one at a time, in a worker thread, on one shared gate for both
  transports. They share files without locks. A slow tool does not freeze
  `/healthz` or shutdown.
- State needs a writable volume. Memory, the session database, and the
  audit log are files. On the read-only image that volume is
  `/var/lib/omega-prime` (`OMEGA_PRIME_STATE_DIR`,
  `OMEGA_PRIME_AUDIT_LOG`); see [Deploying the tool host](deploy.md).
  Approvals are not on that volume: they live in the process and are gone
  after a restart unless you pass `--approve` again.
- Streamable HTTP sessions live in the process (at most `--max-sessions`,
  default 64). One replica, unless a proxy pins a session to it.
