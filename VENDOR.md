# Vendored behavior

Hermes and Omp remain behavior ports: their ignored checkouts are not imported
at runtime. Prime is also a read-only, ignored pin, but optional kernel tools
import its Python `rlm` runtime in-process, and the product's PyO3 bridge links
its Rust libraries. The checkout is not patched or copied into Omega's source
tree. Ported modules retain their upstream MIT notices.

## Prime Agent

- Remote: https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-agent.git
- Commit: `967eb13fd488507af5f590e9c6ea8b2672f1fc05` (2026-10-07)
- Rust toolchain: `1.98.1`, recorded in `omega_prime/contracts/prime-agent.pin.json`.
- License: MIT
- Copyright: PrimeIntellect
- Role: read-only behavior-port source, CI parity oracle, and library source for the optional in-process runtime. The Rust workspace has 9 crates: `pa-telemetry`, `pa-types`, `pa-ai`, `pa-models`, `pa-agent`, `pa-core`, `pa-daemon`, `pa-tui`, `pa-cli`. The kernel-side Python runtime lives in `prime-agent-runtime/src/rlm/`. `native/omega-prime-prime` links those Rust libraries without starting their TUI or daemon supervisor.
- What is adapted (v10): the Python capability contracts for RLM recursion, continual harness, persistent goals, heartbeats, autonomous budgets/gates and agent messaging. The existing Omega conversation loop owns goal/autonomous continuation and named heartbeat re-entry.
- Optional native runtime: `prime.kernel.enabled` imports pinned Python cells/factory/bash/skills; `OmegaPrimeAgent.from_prime` calls actual Rust providers independently of that flag. Linked-crate probes are diagnostics, not a full native application merge. A live child runner is still required for RLM child execution.
- What is not integrated: native `pa-agent` or `pa-core::SessionEngine` ownership of the loop, the TUI, CLI binary, daemon supervisor/process model, telemetry sinks, managed AWS/Vertex authentication, and upstream installers.
- The Phase 53 “622 passed” number is not the full workspace. It is the sum of `test result: ok` lines in an unskipped fail-fast run (exit 101) that stopped in `pa-cli` `acp_mode_e2e` (42 passed, 3 failed in that binary). `pa-core`, `pa-daemon`, `pa-models`, `pa-telemetry`, `pa-tui`, and `pa-types` had not started.
- Local `cargo test --workspace --locked` matches the CI oracle only when all four of these hold:
  - `prime-agent` is absent from `PATH`. `pa-cli` differential tests treat `which prime-agent` as a TypeScript oracle unless `PA_TS_BINARY` is set, and they skip when that lookup misses. A published 0.9.8 binary is the wrong oracle: it fails `differential_corpus_matches_ts_binary` on the package-update hint (`update --force` versus `update`). It also runs `ts_daemon_differential_cli_output`. That test expects `send` to print `Sent to ...`. Without a model credential both CLIs exit 1 with the same `No API key found for the selected model` text, and paths point at the installed release under `~/.local/share/prime-agent/releases/`. Identical stderr is still a failure. Measured locally on 2026-10-08 with `/root/.local/bin/prime-agent` → 0.9.8 (`83fb0912…`): workspace `cargo test` exited 101 on that one test.
  - Provider credentials are unset, including `GH_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. With those set, startup resolution selects `github-copilot/claude-fable-5` and the catalog lists `github-copilot` and `openrouter` beside `prime-inference`. Three `pa-daemon` tests then fail: `the_startup_chain_refuses_models_outside_the_allowlist`, `switch_model_never_poisons_the_selection_with_a_refused_candidate`, and `model_catalog_and_available_models_match_the_ts_shapes`. CI does not export them.
  - `futimens` updates ctime. `cache_rejects_replacement_and_same_length_in_place_rewrite` restores mtime after a same-length rewrite and expects the scan generation (`len`, inode, mtime, ctime) to change. On Linux 6.8.0-142 / ext4 here, `futimens` leaves ctime unchanged, and a rewrite inside one timestamp tick keeps the generation identical, so the cached name stays `bravo` while the file reads `delta`. The test is not in the pin skip set. The parity gate is `ubuntu-latest`, where `futimens` bumps ctime. Re-ran 2026-10-08 with `--exact` filter `session_store::info_tests::cache_rejects_replacement_and_same_length_in_place_rewrite` (exit 101, 0.01s). Panic at `session_store_info_tests.rs:195` inside `assert_fold_matches`: `read_session_info` returned `name: Some("bravo")` and `legacy_read_session_info` returned `name: Some("delta")`. Result line: 0 passed, 1 failed, 965 filtered. The 965 are the other lib tests excluded by `--exact`, and this is the same lib failure already counted below, not a second one.
  - `imported_session_compacts` counts `type: message` rows in the first directory entry whose name starts with `grown-import`. The import writes `grown-import.jsonl` and the window sidecar `grown-import.window-cache.json` (`path.with_extension("window-cache.json")`). On this ext4 mount, `readdir` returns the sidecar first; that order is stable across creation order. The sidecar has no message rows, so the count is 0 against 3600 after a successful import. Reproduced in isolation on 2026-10-08 in 1.70s. `/tmp` is this root ext4, not a tmpfs. The test is not in the pin skip set.
- A path-clean skip-set run on 2026-10-08 (`prime-agent` absent from `PATH`, provider credentials unset) was interrupted in `pa-daemon` `stop_escalation_e2e` (`a_well_behaved_worker_keeps_the_clean_stop` had passed; the second test had not finished). Finished targets: 3249 passed, 2 failed, 19 ignored, 3 filtered (the ACP skips). The failures are the ctime test and `imported_session_compacts`. 3249 is not a workspace total.
- The five `pa-daemon` targets the interrupted run had not finished were re-run the same day, same environment, `--no-fail-fast`. `stop_escalation_e2e` 2 passed, including `a_hung_worker_is_killed_within_the_escalation_window_and_its_lease_frees` in 62.38s. `thinking_level_e2e` 4 passed, `thinking_level_roster_e2e` 2 passed, `worker_orphan_exit_e2e` 2 passed, `worker_stderr_e2e` 2 passed. `import_compaction_e2e` failed again in 1.70s (0 vs 3600). That closes the `pa-daemon` integration list; the only failure in it is `imported_session_compacts`.
- The four crates that had not started were run the same day, same environment: `cargo test --locked --no-fail-fast -p pa-models -p pa-telemetry -p pa-tui -p pa-types` (exit 0, 370s). Totals: `pa-models` 73 passed across 5 targets, `pa-telemetry` 68 passed across 3 targets, `pa-tui` 1537 passed across 49 targets, `pa-types` 150 passed across 5 targets. Together 1828 passed, 0 failed, 0 ignored, across 62 result lines. Doc-tests in all four crates ran 0 tests; those four lines are among the 62 and add 0 to the 1828. 1828 is not a workspace total: `pa-ai`, `pa-agent`, `pa-core`, `pa-cli`, and `pa-daemon` are not in it. The same log's ctime filter was `session_store_info_tests::cache_rejects_replacement_and_same_length_in_place_rewrite`. That module is `session_store::info_tests` (`#[path = "session_store_info_tests.rs"]`), so the filter matched nothing: 0 passed, 966 filtered, exit 0. It did not execute the ctime test.
- Doc-tests are not inside the 3249. Cargo prints them after every selected lib, bin, and integration target, and the interrupted log has no `Doc-tests` line. The same day, same hermetic environment: `cargo test --locked --doc --no-fail-fast -p pa-ai -p pa-agent -p pa-core -p pa-cli -p pa-daemon` (exit 0). Each of those five crates ran 0 doc-tests.
- Local no-fail-fast total for the default `cargo test --workspace --locked` targets, with the three ACP skips filtered, is **5089 passed, 2 failed, 19 ignored, 3 filtered**. Arithmetic: 3249 (finished targets before the interrupt) + 12 (the five `pa-daemon` integration binaries that had not emitted a result line) + 1828 (the four crates, including their empty doc-tests). The five crates' doc-tests add 0. The two failures are the ctime test and `imported_session_compacts`. The 965-filtered and 966-filtered lib invocations are not in this total. Examples and benches are outside the default set CI runs. CI itself is fail-fast and does not print this sum; on `ubuntu-latest` the two ext4 hazards above are not the expected result.

### Linked crates

The sources are read from `prime-agent/crates/<name>/`, the ignored checkout.
`native/omega-prime-prime/` is the only Rust Omega Prime authors: a PyO3 library
that links all nine crates. Its built output is
`prime-agent/target/debug/libomega_prime_prime.so`. A running tool host reports
the link through `prime_crates`. "Probe only" means the sole caller is
`crates.probe()`, which `prime_crates` exposes.

| Crate | Upstream role | In Omega Prime today |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pa-core` | Session engine: tools, skills, prompts, kernel, subagents, settings | Used: `prime_goal` and `prime_autonomous` run its `/goal` and `/autonomous` parsing and state. `SessionEngine` is not used. |
| `pa-ai` | Provider APIs, model registry, streaming | Used: `ai.complete` behind `PrimeProviderModel`, selected explicitly with `OmegaPrimeAgent.from_prime`. |
| `pa-models` | Live model catalog | Bound as `ai.resolve_models`, which callers use to pick a descriptor for `from_prime`. Otherwise probe only. |
| `pa-types` | Shared domain and wire types | Indirect: goal state and frame types inside the bridge. |
| `pa-agent` | Agent loop | Probe only (argument validation). Its loop is not used. |
| `pa-telemetry` | Event schema, queues, sinks | Probe only. |
| `pa-daemon` | Session supervisor, workers, wire protocol | Probe only (frame encoding, durable-create command). There is no process model. |
| `pa-tui` | Terminal UI | Probe only (session-search scoring). |
| `pa-cli` | The `prime-agent` binary | Probe only (mode names, missing-subsystem text). |

## Merge rule

One Python process. One `OmegaPrimeAgent`. Where the upstreams implement the same concern, one Omega Prime implementation has to satisfy all invariants. Temporal is not the merge. It can become a durability adapter after cron and delegation exist.
