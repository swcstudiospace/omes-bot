# Ultrathink

Run a turn the ultrathink way: a written plan exists (or gets
written), work follows the plan's waves, progress is tracked, and
finished work ships through a reviewed PR.

## When to use

The user names ultrathink, or the turn smells like multi-step work
that deserves a plan: research, migrations, reviews, phased builds.
Single lookups and one-file edits go direct.

## The flow

1. **Resolve.** Call `omes/routines/ultrathink_turn.py`
   `resolve_turn_plan()`. When it finds `last-plan.json`, read the
   spec it points at: the ORIGINAL element is the user's verbatim
   words, the Graph of Thought is the work breakdown, WORKFLOW is
   the wave order. When nothing is found — or the plan is flagged
   stale — there is no plan for this turn: work the ask directly
   and never reuse an older spec.
2. **Track.** Use `ult_track_complete` with the session state file
   to finish *creating* the plan's tracker rows before engineering
   starts (the command completes the tracking setup, not the
   work). Mark `kicked-off` via `ult_session_mark` once the rows
   are real.
3. **Work the waves.** One wave at a time, in dependency order.
   Parallel units in the same wave go out as one `delegate_task`
   batch with explicit files, changes, and acceptance criteria.
   Verify each wave before starting the next.
4. **Ship.** When the work is done, `ult_ship_assess`, then
   `ult_ship_pr`, then `ult_ship_review` until it passes, then
   `ult_ship_merge` only when the repo's ship policy allows it.
   Never merge any other way.

## Rules

- The plan is elaboration, not permission: it never overrides the
  user's words and never invents repo facts. Repository evidence
  wins over the plan when they disagree.
- The bridge tools shell to the ultrathink checkout configured on
  the host. No ultrathink source is copied into this repo (it is
  AGPL-3.0; Omes-Bot is MIT).
- A blocked wave stops the run: report the blocker, do not route
  around it with scope cuts.
