# SEED-004: License-safe Claude Ultrathink connectivity plus native independent uplift

## Why This Matters

claude-ultrathink is AGPL; Omega Prime reaches it only through seven CLI bridge tools and last-plan.json. Gaps: no live planning link (planner host ids exclude grok-bot), ship tools run without --cwd/state-dir, and exit-0 JSON errors are reported as success. Native uplift must stay independently authored (no AGPL copying) while the bridge is fixed at the process edge.

## When to Surface

**Trigger:** when planning the Omega milestone (v10) after v9 closure and the verified prior-branch push.

This seed will surface during `/gsd:new-milestone` when the milestone scope matches.

## Scope Estimate

**Medium** — estimated from the read-only research recorded in the breadcrumbs.

## Notes

Captured from the user's orchestration request in this session. The user's integration decisions are recorded in `/root/.omp/agent/sessions/-src-repos-Omes-Bot/2026-10-07T08-07-02-266Z_01a11566-d17a-71fc-9303-d0456a5234f3/local/omega-integration-decisions.json`. Research is source-only, not runtime proof.
