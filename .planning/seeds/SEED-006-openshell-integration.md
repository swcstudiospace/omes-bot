# SEED-006: NVIDIA OpenShell sandboxed execution and verification

## Why This Matters

OpenShell (Apache-2.0; installed here as /usr/bin/openshell 0.1.2) provides policy-enforced sandboxes. Omega Prime ships only a hand-maintained sandbox-policy.yaml that nothing generates or tests; execute/verification paths do not run inside a sandbox, and sandbox writable paths do not match Omega Prime home/root defaults. Integration should run verification inside OpenShell sandboxes with a policy generated from the seat policy and provider-based credentials.

## When to Surface

**Trigger:** when planning the Omega milestone (v10) after v9 closure and the verified prior-branch push.

This seed will surface during `/gsd:new-milestone` when the milestone scope matches.

## Scope Estimate

**Medium** — estimated from the read-only research recorded in the breadcrumbs.

## Notes

Captured from the user's orchestration request in this session. The user's integration decisions are recorded in `/root/.omp/agent/sessions/-src-repos-Omes-Bot/2026-10-07T08-07-02-266Z_01a11566-d17a-71fc-9303-d0456a5234f3/local/omega-integration-decisions.json`. Research is source-only, not runtime proof.
