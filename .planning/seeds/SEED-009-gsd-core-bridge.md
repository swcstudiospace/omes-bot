# SEED-009: Native /gsd commands bridged to the installed GSD-Core

## Why This Matters

GSD-Core (MIT, open-gsd; v1.14.0 installed at ~/.agents/gsd-core) is absent from the product today. User decision: bridge rather than vendor; Omega native /gsd commands call the installed gsd-tools and load GSD workflows when present, reporting unavailable otherwise.

## When to Surface

**Trigger:** when planning the Omega milestone (v10) after v9 closure and the verified prior-branch push.

This seed will surface during `/gsd:new-milestone` when the milestone scope matches.

## Scope Estimate

**Medium** — estimated from the read-only research recorded in the breadcrumbs.

## Notes

Captured from the user's orchestration request in this session. The user's integration decisions are recorded in `/root/.omp/agent/sessions/-src-repos-Omes-Bot/2026-10-07T08-07-02-266Z_01a11566-d17a-71fc-9303-d0456a5234f3/local/omega-integration-decisions.json`. Research is source-only, not runtime proof.
