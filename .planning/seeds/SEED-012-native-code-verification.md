# SEED-012: Native code verification bound to executed commands

## Why This Matters

Verification today is partial: receipts are structure-checked and model-written, not tied to executed commands; the gate runner only checks the Omega Prime repo with whatever python3 is on PATH; Greptile is unconfigured. Omega must verify target-repo code by actually running gates (sandboxed where available) and binding receipts to the recorded runs.

## When to Surface

**Trigger:** when planning the Omega milestone (v10) after v9 closure and the verified prior-branch push.

This seed will surface during `/gsd:new-milestone` when the milestone scope matches.

## Scope Estimate

**Large** — estimated from the read-only research recorded in the breadcrumbs.

## Notes

Captured from the user's orchestration request in this session. The user's integration decisions are recorded in `/root/.omp/agent/sessions/-src-repos-Omes-Bot/2026-10-07T08-07-02-266Z_01a11566-d17a-71fc-9303-d0456a5234f3/local/omega-integration-decisions.json`. Research is source-only, not runtime proof.
