## Current Test

number: 1
name: Inspect the hosted 9-combination + docs run for the pushed matching head.
expected: |
  All 9 verify/lint/types jobs plus docs complete; named guard testcase passed; exits recorded.
awaiting: user response

## Tests

### 1. Inspect the hosted 9-combination + docs run for the pushed matching head.
expected: All 9 verify/lint/types jobs plus docs complete; named guard testcase passed; exits recorded.
result: [pending]

### 2. Run the stopped-writer real 3-lane union on actual 3.12/3.13/3.14 interpreters.
expected: Full suite (with named guard), evals, assembly, Ruff, mypy, pip check green per lane.
result: [pending]

### 3. Confirm adjacent-lane isolation on the hosted run (one failing combination does not cancel siblings, yet still fails the workflow).
expected: fail-fast:false retains sibling receipts; workflow conclusion still fails.
result: [pending]

### 4. Confirm empty-install-input impossibility on the hosted run (every matrix job installs before gating; failed install records dependents as not_run, never passed).
expected: Receipt summaries show not_run for dependents of any failed install; no pass without install.
result: [pending]
